# QA portfolio
I am a self-motivated learner with a strong interest in Quality Assurance (QA) practices. Currently, I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. I am actively building my QA portfolio by learning and applying key QA concepts and tools.

My focus areas include:

Manual testing, with hands-on experience in real-life scenarios such as banking app security.

Developing test cases, executing tests, and documenting results to ensure software quality.

Learning and utilizing version control systems, especially GitHub, to manage code and improve commit practices.

Continuously exploring best practices in software testing, bug reporting, and defect tracking.

I am passionate about ensuring software reliability and user satisfaction through thorough testing and attention to detail. My goal is to expand my expertise in QA methodologies
